# Projective islands in $\Pi_k^y$

As defined in Section 4, $\Pi_k^y$ is the set of projective islands with representativity $y$ and ring size $k$.
By running `proj_island.py`, the `*.dconf` files corresponding to each island will be generated in each of the `./y-k/dconf/` directory.
(For example, the 14 projective islands $\Pi_3^6$ are generated in the `./3-6/dconf/` directory.)

The output of the reduciblility checker for each island is logged in `./y-k/log/`, and the summary (reducibility type and contraction edge set) is summarized in `./y-k/summary.csv`.
